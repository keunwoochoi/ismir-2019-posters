### [B-02] Deep Unsupervised Drum Transcription | [paper](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/paper/000020.pdf) | [code](https://github.com/keunwoochoi/DrummerNet)

[Keunwoo Choi](https://keunwoochoi.wordpress.com); [Kyunghyun Cho](http://www.kyunghyuncho.me)
> "DrummerNet is a drum transcriber trained in an unsupervised fashion. DrummerNet learns to transcribe by learning to reconstruct the audio with the transcription estimate. Unsupervised learning + a large dataset allow DrummerNet to be less-biased."

### [L-10] Creating a Tool for Faciltiating and Researching Human Annotation of Musical Patterns | [paper](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/latebreaking/000010.pdf) | [code](https://github.com/StephanWells/ANOMIC)

[Stephan Wells](); [Iris Yuping Ren](http://irisryp.me/); [Anja Volk](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~fleis102/)
> "Musical patterns (repeated segments of music) are highly widespread in all varieties of music, and annotations of such patterns are valuable in many areas of music information retrieval. Unfortunately, there is a lack of expert annotations of musical patterns, and most annotation is done by hand. In this project, we introduce a novel software, ANOMIC, designed for users to intuitively annotate repeated musical segments, and we perform a user study which yields a large database of annotations done using the tool. We find that the toolâ€™s reception was strongly positive and show that the annotations done with it reach high levels of inter-annotator agreement compared to traditional approaches."
