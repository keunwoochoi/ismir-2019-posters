### [G-12] Audio-query Based Music Source Separation | [paper](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/paper/000108.pdf)

Jie Hwan Lee(*); Hyeong-Seok Choi(*); Kyogu Lee (*: Equal contribution)
> “We propose a network for audio query-based music source separation that can explicitly encode the source information from a query signal regardless of the number and/or kind of target signals. The proposed method consists of a Query-net and a Separator: given a query and a mixture, the Query-net encodes the query into the latent space, and the Separator estimates masks conditioned by the latent vector, which is then applied to the mixture for separation.”

## Late-Breaking/Demo

### [L-06] Tools for Semi-Automatic Bounding Box Annotation of Musical Measures in Sheet Music | [paper](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/latebreaking/000006.pdf) | [web](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/2019-ISMIR-LBD-Measures)

> "In score following, one main goal is to highlight measure positions in sheet music synchronously to audio playback. Such applications require alignments between sheet music and audio representations. Often, such alignments can be computed automatically in the case that the sheet music representations are given in some symbolically encoded music format. However, sheet music is often available only in the form of digitized scans. In this case, the automated computation of accurate alignments poses still many challenges [1]. In this contribution, we present various semi-automatic tools for solving the subtask of determining bounding boxes (given in pixels) of measure positions in digital scans of sheet music—a task that is extremely tedious when being done manually."

### [L-07] Improving Music Tagging from Audio with User-Track Interactions | [paper](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/latebreaking/000007.pdf)

[Andres Ferraro](https://github.com/andrebola); [Jae Ho Jeon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jae-ho-jeon-036927126); [Jisang Yoon](https://github.com/js1010); [Xavier Serra](https://www.upf.edu/web/xavier-serra); [Dmitry Bogdanov](https://dbogdanov.github.io/about/)
> "We propose to improve the tagging of music by using audio and collaborative filtering information (user-track interactions). We use Matrix Factorization (MF) to obtain a representation of the tracks from the user-track interactions and map those representations to the tags predicted from audio. The preliminary results show that following this approach we can increase the tagging performance."

### [L-10] Creating a Tool for Faciltiating and Researching Human Annotation of Musical Patterns | [paper](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/latebreaking/000010.pdf) | [code](https://github.com/StephanWells/ANOMIC)

[Stephan Wells](); [Iris Yuping Ren](http://irisryp.me/); [Anja Volk](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~fleis102/)
> "Musical patterns (repeated segments of music) are highly widespread in all varieties of music, and annotations of such patterns are valuable in many areas of music information retrieval. Unfortunately, there is a lack of expert annotations of musical patterns, and most annotation is done by hand. In this project, we introduce a novel software, ANOMIC, designed for users to intuitively annotate repeated musical segments, and we perform a user study which yields a large database of annotations done using the tool. We find that the tool’s reception was strongly positive and show that the annotations done with it reach high levels of inter-annotator agreement compared to traditional approaches."

### [L-11] nnAudio: A Pytorch Audio Processing Tool Using 1dconvolution Neural Networks | [paper]() | [code](https://github.com/KinWaiCheuk/nnAudio)

[Kin Wai Cheuk](https://github.com/KinWaiCheuk); [Kat Agres](http://katagres.com/biography); [Dorien Herremans](http://dorienherremans.com/biography)
> "With the advent of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs),  many computational methods, such as Tensorflow and PyTorch, are now taking advantage of these technologies to dramatically speed up calculations. The number of GPU based processing libraries for signal processing is limited to tools such as tf.signal, torchaudio (PyTorch based), and Kapre (Tensorflow based).
We propose a PyTorch based neural network audio processing tool called nnAudio. Our library offer GPU-leveraged calculation of linear spectrograms, log spectrograms, Mel Spectrograms (MelSpec), and constant-Q transform (CQT). nnAudio is the only GPU-based library that offers CQT calculation. We record a speed increase of over 100 times when using nnAudio versus traditional signal processing tools"

### [L-12] Generative Audio Synthesis with a Parametric Model | [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08335) | [Audio Examples](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/student/~krishnasubramani/ismir_notebook.html)

[Krishna Subramani](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/student/~krishnasubramani/); Alexandre D'Hooge; [Preeti Rao](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/prao)
> Propose a parametric representation for audio corresponding more directly to its musical attributes such as pitch, dynamics and timbre. For more control over generation, we also propose the use of a conditional variational autoencoder which conditions the timbre on pitch.

### [L-45] An Opensource Web-based Pattern Annotation Framework - PAF | [paper](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/latebreaking/000045.pdf) | [code](https://bitbucket.org/ul-fri-lgm/patternannotationframework/src)

[Matevž Pesek](); [Darian Tomašević](); [Iris Yuping Ren](http://irisryp.me/); [Matija Marolt]()
> "The Pattern Annotation Framework (PAF) tool collects the data about the annotator and the annotation process, to enable an analysis of relations between the user's experience/background and the annotations. The tool tracks the user's actions, such as the start and end time of an individual annotation and its changes, midi player actions and other. By open-sourcing the tool, we hope to aid other researchers in the MIR field dealing with pattern-related data gathering."
